Event’s description

Event’s image (link to the image)

Event’s capacity (number of people)

Event’s contact e-mail

Event’s contact phone number

Event’s address (physical location, including street name and number, ZIP code and city name)

Event’s URL

Event’s Type (predefined list like “music”, “sport”, “movie”, “theater” etc.).
